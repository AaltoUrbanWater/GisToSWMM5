# GisToSWMM5

GisToSWMM5 is a tool for automatically constructing [SWMM5](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm) model descriptions.  

The input files for the tool can be prepared using GIS software and the resulting SWMM model can be studied in GIS. The tool takes elevation, land-use, and flow direction information from the user-prepared input files, creates subcatchments for the studied area, and routes water between subcatchments and into the stormwater network.

The tool was originally developed by Lassi Warsta (lassi[a]warsta.net) at the Aalto University School of Engineering. The tool is distributed under MIT-license.

### Using GisToSWMM5

GisToSWMM5 is used via the command prompt or using a batch file.  

The main inputs to the tool are elevation, land-use, and flow direction rasters, which have to be defined with the same grid. The cell size of these raster grids defines the minimum size of the final subcatchments.  

More information regarding the input files is given in [input_files.md](input_files.md).  

Using the tool is easiest with a script (batch) file where the necessary input files are presented. The script file should consist of the following lines, which are the inputs to the GisToSWMM5:

[PATH TO GisToSWMM5 EXECUTABLE] \  
[PATH TO DEM RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO FLOW DIRECTION RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO LANDUSE RASTER IN .asc FORMAT] \  
[PATH TO CATCHMENT PROPERTIES TABLE IN .csv FORMAT] \

GisToSWMM5 can be used to build a SWMM5 model in three modes:
1. Each raster cell forms an individual subcatchment.  
In this case, the run script is as above.  

2. (*Recommended*) Cells with the same land-use and same eventual outlet are merged to form subcatchments.  
In this case, an additional line with any integer number is required as the last line of the script:  
[*OPTIONAL* INTEGER VALUE]  

3. (*Legacy mode, not recommended*) Neighboring *2<sup>N</sup>* x *2<sup>N</sup>* cells, where *N* = 1, 2, 3, ..., are merged together into subcatchments and the most abundant landuse among cells is set as the subcatchment landuse.  
In this case, the maximum grid cell size and the allowed number of subdivisions (*N*) are required as the two last lines of the script:  
[*OPTIONAL* MAXIMUM GRID CELL SIDE LENGTH] \  
[*OPTIONAL* NUMBER OF SUBDIVISIONS FOR GRID CELLS]  

An example script for running the tool is given in [run_scripts](run_scripts) folder. The easiest way to build models for new areas is to modify the example run script and input files as necessary.

### Output files

GisToSWMM5 produces the following output files:
- A SWMM input file that can be used to run  SWMM simulations  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME].inp)
- A vector file defining the subcatchments according to mode 1  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt, where *L* is the side length of the cells in DEM, land-use, and flow direction rasters)
- A vector file defining the routing between the raster cells  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routing.wkt)
- A vector file defining the routing between the raster cells that are routed into the catchment outfall  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routed.wkt)
- A vector file defining the routing of the storm-water network  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_network_routing.wkt)

When GisToSWMM5 is used to create merged subcatchments in mode 2, two additional files are created:
- a raster file defining the subcatchments  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc)
- a vector file defining the attributes of the subcatchments  
([PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt)

The vector files are created using the Well Known Text (wkt) vector format. E.g. QGIS can natively understand .wkt-files. For conversion to shapefiles using e.g. ogr2ogr command line operation, a .csvt file defining the field types of .wkt file is created. The produced vector files allow for easily studying the SWMM model using a GIS software without the need of using SWMM GUI.

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt" file has the
following attributes:  

| Name | Description |  
| --- |---|
| id | |
| wkt | Polygon defining the shape of the  subcatchment |
| name | Name of the  subcatchment |
| outlet    | Name of node or another subcatchment that receives runoff |
| area_m2   | Subcatchment area (m2) |
| slope_pct | Subcatchment slope (%) |
| elevation | Subcatchment elevation |
| landuse   | Code for land-use type |
| imp_pct   | Percent of impervious area (%) |
| n_imp     | Manning's N for impervious area (-) |
| n_per     | Manning's N for pervious area (-) |
| S_imp_mm  | Depth of depression storage on impervious area (mm) |
| S_per_mm  | Depth of depression storage on pervious area (mm) |
| suct_mm   | Soil capillary suction head (mm) |
| Ksat_mmhr | Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm/hr) |
| IMDmax    | Difference between soil porosity and initial moisture content (a fraction) |
| isSink | An indicator showing if the cell is a local sink/pit in the catchment (0: no; 1: yes; 2: cell is connected directly to a node) |
| Tag | An optional string description for the landuse class |

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routing.wkt" and the "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m_routed.wkt" files have the following attributes:  

| Name | Description  |  
| ---|---|
| id |   |
| wkt | Line object defining the route between "from" and "to" subcatchments |
| from | Name of the origin subcatchment |
| to | Name of the target subcatchment |  

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_network_routing.wkt" file has the following attributes:  

| Name | Description |
| -----|---|
| id   |  |
| wkt  | Line object defining the route between "from" and "to" subcatchments |
| name | Name of the conduit |
| from | Name of the origin junction |
| to   | Name of the target junction |

The "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc" file has an integer in each raster cell indicating the corresponding subcatchment for the cell. If the cell does not belong to a subcatchment -1 is used.   

The format of "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt" file is equal to "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_*L*x*L*m.wkt". The only difference is that "wkt" represents only the cell at the subcatchment center-of-mass-point, and not the entire subcatchment. The attribute "id" corresponds to the integer value of subcatchment in "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc".

### Utility tools
Folder [utils](utils) contains utility programs for various tasks:

#### inp2gis.py ####
Extracts subcatchment polygons and routing between subcatchments from a SWMM input file (\*.inp). The tool saves the subcatchments as a polygon shapefile and the routing between the subcatchment polygon centroids as a line shapefile.  

This utility tool is suitable for any SWMM5 input file, i.e., it is not restricted to GisToSWMM5 generated files.  

#### rpt2gis.py ####  
Extracts subcatchment polygons from a SWMM5 input file (\*.inp) and subcatchment simulation results from the corresponding SWMM5 report file (by default \*.rpt). The tool merges the information and saves the subcatchment results as a polygon shapefile.  

This utility tool is suitable for any SWMM5 input/report file, i.e., it is not restricted to GisToSWMM5 generated files.  

#### ExtractLinkData.py ####  
Collates time series data from a given link (in several) SWMM5 report file(s) into a single .csv file.  

This utility tool is suitable for any SWMM5 report file, i.e., it is not restricted to GisToSWMM5 generated files.  

#### adap2shp.py ####  
Creates a shapefile of adaptive subcatchments with given subcatchment attributes using the information from "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc" and "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments_attr.wkt" files.  

#### ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py ####   
Extracts subcatchment summary results from the SWMM5 report file (by default \*.rpt) and presents them as subcatchment attributes in a Well-Known-Text file. Particularly useful for creating subcatchment runoff results shapefile from adaptive model results, as this shapefile cannot be directly produced using the \*.inp and \*.rpt files. To produce the shapefile, first create a \*.wkt file of subcatchment runoff results using *ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py* and then use *adap2shp.py* with the "[PATH TO OUTPUT BASE FILENAME]\_subcatchments.asc" and the newly created \*.wkt file as inputs to produce the final shapefile.  

#### wkt2shp.sh ####  
Converts all .wkt files in a given folder into shapefiles (e.g. for ArcMap).


#### Practicalities ####  
The utility tools are written in python 3.\* and bash. They have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS and to some degree on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS and on Windows 10. The python scripts use the following non-standard packages:
- pandas (ExtractLinkData.py, ExtractSubcatchmentResults.py, inp2gis.py, rpt2gis.py, adap2shp.py)
- geopandas (inp2gis.py, rpt2gis.py, adap2shp.py)
- shapely (inp2gis.py, rpt2gis.py)
- rasterio (adap2shp.py)

Using [Anaconda(/Miniconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution is highly recommended. It is an open source distribution of Python, intended especially for data science and machine learning. In practice, it makes life a lot easier when installing Python packages even when dealing with simple scripts such as here.

It is recommended to create a conda environment using the available [utils/environment.yml](utils/environment.yml) to install the required dependencies:

1. Download and install [Anaconda(/Miniconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)  
2. Open terminal (Linux) or Anaconda prompt (Windows)
3. Navigate to [utils/](utils/)
3. Run the following command to create the Anaconda/Miniconda environment (note that this may take some time to finish)   
`conda env create -f environment.yml`  
5. (Linux) Activate the environment using the following command   
`conda activate gistoswmm5`
6. Use the utility tools.

While using inp2gis.py, rpt2gis.py, etc. is relatively simple in Linux environment, in Windows environment it is easiest to use them with batch scripts. Batch scripts for running the utility programs are therefore given in  [run_scripts](run_scripts) folder. These batch scripts automatically activate the Anaconda/Miniconda environment before executing the script.

In case 'activate' command for Anaconda(/Miniconda) does not work from command line on Windows, or the batch scripts complain that 'activate' is not recognized as a valid command, the quick fix is to add path to Anaconda(/Miniconda) Scripts folder to the end of your PATH environmental variable (usually 'C:\Users\\[USER]\Miniconda3\Scripts' or 'C:\Users\\[USER]\Anaconda3\Scripts')   
(On Windows 10: Go to Control Panel &rarr; search for 'path' &rarr; Edit environment variables for your account &rarr; Select 'Path' &rarr; Edit &rarr; New &rarr; Add the path to the Scripts folder &rarr; OK &rarr; OK)


### Demo case
Folder [demo_catchment](demo_catchment) contains an example dataset and run scripts for GisToSWMM5 using a small imaginary catchment. Following subfolders are included:
- [data](demo_catchment/data) contains the necessary files required to run GisToSWMM5.
- [GIS](demo_catchment/GIS) contains files corresponding to [data](demo_catchment/data) files in a (more) GIS-friendly format alongside a QGIS-project file with the files already imported.
- [out](demo_catchment/out) contains the output files of GisToSWMM5 in [SWMM_in](demo_catchment/out/SWMM_in), the output files of SWMM in [SWMM_out](demo_catchment/out/SWMM_out), and finally the SWMM result time series and spatial data in [SWMM_results](demo_catchment/out/SWMM_results).
- [QGIS_styles](demo_catchment/QGIS_styles) contains QGIS style definition files that may be helpful in visualizing the GisToSWMM5 input and output files in QGIS.

The example scripts in folder [run_scripts](run_scripts) can be used to run GisToSWMM5 using the given example data, and to collect the subcatchment runoff results and the result timeseries from the SWMM output files.

### Using SWMM5
The GisToSWMM5-produced SWMM5 input file (.inp) should be immediately usable with SWMM software. The following points are worth noticing, however:
- The SWMM5 models produced using GisToSWMM5 are inteded to be run from the command line. They typically have at least an order-of-magnitude difference in the number subcatchments to a manually constructed model, and therefore the SWMM GUI may not be able to even open the resulting model.
- The demo uses relative (to SWMM executable location) paths to climate and rainfall input  files. It is often necessary to open the SWMM input file in a text editor and to correct the paths in the file manually.  
- The tool is extremely sensitive to the amount of whitespace characters in input files. The most common problems related to use of the tool seem to be related to locating and removing the extra whitespace from these files. Even if the tool succeeds to run, the resulting SWMM input file may not work if there has been extra whitespace in the input files to the tool.
